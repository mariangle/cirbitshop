<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Introduction

This project is an improved version of my initial ecommerce app while also serving as a continuation of my [ecommerce CMS project](https://github.com/mariangle/nextjs-ecommerce-cms). All the content within this ecommerce platform is sourced through various API calls from the ecommerce CMS project. Any modifications made in the admin CMS will be reflected and displayed on this store. For testing of payment processing, use Stripe's [Test Card](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

Here are the main improvements from old first ecommerce:

- **Enhanced Filtering**: Unlike my previous project that fetched all products and performed filtering in the Redux store, this project implements query-based filtering directly from the API, resulting in improved performance.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: The project dynamically generates navigation options based on categories added in the CMS. This ensures that new categories automatically appear in the navigation menu without requiring manual adjustments.
- **Improved Code Structure**: The codebase of this project follows better architectural practices, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Stability**: This project is more reliable and stable in deployment, addressing the breakability concerns associated with the previous ecommerce project. It also features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices.
- **TypeScript Integration**: This project utilizes TypeScript, offering type safety and improved code quality compared to plain JavaScript.
